# *perf-cpp*: Changelog

## v0.8.0
* Restructured the build-system – thanks to [@foolnotion](https://github.com/jmuehlig/perf-cpp/commits?author=foolnotion): 
  * Examples are no longer included into default build and must be activated with `-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=1` (see [documentation](docs/build.md#build-examples)). 
  * New feature: Added option to install the library using `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/libperf-cpp` (see [documentation](docs/build.md#install-the-library)).
* New feature: Define period or frequency along with trigger events when sampling (see [documentation](docs/sampling.md#period--frequency)).
* New feature: `cgroup` sampling (see [documentation](docs/sampling.md#cgroup)).
* New feature: Sampling for context switches (see [documentation](docs/sampling.md#context-switches)).
* New feature: Sampling for throttle events (see [documentation](docs/sampling.md#throttle-and-unthrottle-events)).
* New feature: Sampling for raw values (see [documentation](docs/sampling.md#raw-values)).
* New feature: Sampling for transaction aborts (see [documentation](docs/sampling.md#transaction-abort)).
* New feature: Print results from `perf::EventCounter` as a table using `perf::CounterResult::to_string()`.
* Automatically discover AMD Instruction Based Sampling (IBS) PMUs when running on AMD hardware ([see documentation](docs/sampling.md#amd-instruction-based-sampling)).
* Automatically discover Intel Processor Event Based Sampling (PEBS) memory events when running on Intel hardware ([see documentation](docs/sampling.md#intel-pebs)).
* Enable Intel PEBS by default (used interrupt-based sampling so far, if not specified otherwise in `perf::SampleConfig::precise_ip()`).
* Support Linux Kernel down to `4.0` – Kernels no longer need to be specified via compiler defines.
* Close sampler automatically (i.e., free all buffers and close counters) when destructing.

## v0.7.1
* Fixed compilation error on ARM machines (`__builtin_cpu_is()` is not supported) – thanks to [@Tratori](https://github.com/Tratori).

## v0.7.0

This release comes with many new features, especially focusing on the interface for sampling and error handling using exceptions. 
Please note that we will maintain backward compatibility for the "old"-styled interface until `v0.8.0`. 
Deprecated interfaces are marked as such using `[[deprecated()]]` annotations and may yield warnings during compilation.

Changelog:

* Samples can now be asked if they contain losses (and if so, how many). Sample records can be lost, e.g., if the buffer is out of capacity or the CPU is too busy.
* Errors when adding performance counters and opening/starting samplers are now communicated via exceptions instead of an error variable.
* Introduced a new interface for specifying the data that should be recorded for triggers through `Sampler::values()`.
* Introduced a new interface for specifying the triggers for sampling through `Sampler::trigger()`.
* Added the option to use multiple triggers for sampling (including example).
* Added the option to use different precisions for each trigger.
* Added the option to `open()` the sampler separately. If the sampler is not opened separately, `start()` will open the sampler.
* Added option to ask samples if they are precise (depends on the precision level for triggers).


## v0.6.0
* Using Counter-Names from `perf::CounterDefinition` (via `std::string_view`) instead of copying strings for more performance.
* Switched from `PERF_MEM_LVL_*` to newer `PERF_MEM_LVLNUM` namespace as `PERF_MEM_LVL_*` is marked as deprecated in `linux/perf_event.h`.
* Added multithread and multicore recording.
* Added multithread and multicore sampling.

## v0.5.0
* Switched to LGPL (instead of AGPL).
* Added more complex `WeightStruct` sampling (via `PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT`) to enable sampling for instruction latencies on newer hardware (e.g., Intel's Sapphire Rapids).
* Implemented debug output for counters by setting an `is_debug` flag in the config.
* Added more complex branch sampling.
* Implemented auto-correct of `precise_ip` configuration if the hardware rejects the initial user-set config.
* Implemented auxiliary counter to enable memory sampling on Intel's Sapphire Rapids.

## v0.4.1
* Disabled counter `cgroup-switches` for Linux Kernel `< 5.13` (was first introduced with that version).
* Disabled sampling for Data Page Size and Code Page Size for Linux Kernel `< 5.11` (was first introduced with that version).

## v0.4.0
* Added support for register sampling.
* Added `make perf-list` to automatically extract perf counters from the underlying hardware.
* Added support for sampling data and code page sizes.

## v0.3.0
* Added support for event sampling.
* Added full documentation.

## v0.2.1
* Fixed `std::move` on `perf::CounterDefintion`.

## v0.2.0
* Added metrics (e.g., CPI).
* Added json/csv conversion from results.
* Added examples.
